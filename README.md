# üî¨ AutoSlide: AI-Powered Histological Analysis

**Unlock the hidden patterns in your histological slides with deep learning**

AutoSlide is a comprehensive pipeline that transforms how researchers analyze histological slides, combining computer vision with deep learning to identify tissues, detect vessels, and quantify fibrosis with unprecedented precision.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automated Tissue Recognition** - Instantly identify and classify different tissue types
- **Smart Region Selection** - Automatically extract the most informative regions for analysis
- **Advanced Vessel Detection** - Precisely locate and measure blood vessels using Mask R-CNN
- **Fibrosis Quantification** - Objectively measure fibrotic changes in tissue samples
- **Reproducible Workflow** - Ensure consistent results across multiple samples and studies

## üöÄ The AutoSlide Pipeline

Our end-to-end workflow transforms raw histological slides into actionable insights:

1. **üîç Initial Annotation** - Intelligent thresholding and region identification
2. **üè∑Ô∏è Final Annotation** - Precise tissue labeling and mask generation
3. **üìä Region Suggestion** - Strategic selection of analysis-ready sections
4. **üß© Pixel Clustering** - Advanced segmentation of tissue components
5. **üî¨ Vessel Detection** - Deep learning-based identification of vascular structures

<summary>## Using DVC for Model and Data Versioning</summary>

# AutoSlide Artifacts

This directory contains model artifacts and other large files used by the AutoSlide project.

## Using DVC for Model and Data Versioning

This project uses [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) to track large files and model artifacts.

### Setup

1. Install DVC:
```bash
pip install dvc
# For Google Drive storage
pip install dvc[gdrive]
# For S3 storage
pip install dvc[s3]
```

2. Initialize DVC in your repository (already done):
```bash
dvc init
```

3. Configure remote storage:
```bash
# For Google Drive
dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://path/to/folder
# For S3
dvc remote add -d myremote s3://bucket/path
```

### Working with DVC

#### Adding files to DVC

```bash
# Add a large file or directory to DVC
dvc add data/large_dataset.svs
dvc add artifacts/mask_rcnn_model.pth
```

This creates a small .dvc file that you commit to git instead of the large file.

#### Pushing and pulling data

```bash
# Push your data to remote storage
dvc push

# Pull data from remote storage
dvc pull
```

#### Versioning models

When you train a new model version:

```bash
# Add the new model file
dvc add artifacts/mask_rcnn_model.pth

# Commit the .dvc file to git
git add artifacts/mask_rcnn_model.pth.dvc
git commit -m "Update model with improved accuracy"

# Push the actual model file to remote storage
dvc push
```

#### Switching between versions

```bash
# Checkout a specific git commit/tag
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Get the corresponding data files
dvc pull
```

### Best Practices

1. Always add large files with DVC, not git
2. Commit .dvc files to git after running `dvc add`
3. Run `dvc push` after adding new files to make them available to others
4. Use `dvc pull` after checkout to get the correct version of data files
